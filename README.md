# WebProjectCovid
In this Project we were asked to create a responsive web page  in order to collect information about the popoulation of certain stores and cafes around Patras,Greece.
The technologies used in this project :
NodeJs
MySql
Javascript
Html 
Css Bootstrap 5 
Leaflet
Specifically,

i) We created a signup/login system with limitations conceening the password and mail.We separated Users and created 3,4 admins for testing purposes.Each one has a different page for altering their profile.

ii) We loaded a map using Leaflet and parsed the Json File given to pinpoint the POIs on the map.

iii) We gave user the ability to dynamic search his favorite store and register his visit to the same store.

iv) If the user happens to suffer from Covid19 , He can register it to the database

iv) When a user was in close proximity to the same store has the ability to instantly see it.

v) The admin on the other hand is capable of watching diagrams based on many factors(visits,covid19 cases)

Generally , It was a nice project and very useful to these hard times.
